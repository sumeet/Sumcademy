# Sumcademy

> The anti-Cracking the Interview<sup>[1](#cracking)</sup> Curriculum

Publishing some of the coding exercises I've given for the off chance these
might be useful to someone. Feel free to do whatever you'd like with these: copy
them, modify them, solve them, etc.

### Course O: 15 exercises (Ruby, webdev, HTTP, sockets)
### Course E: 2 exercises (Node.js, webdev, Golang)
### Course M: 1 exercise (Functional programming, Haskell)
### Course G: 1 exercise (Linux, Command line)

## Other (better) resources
### Puzzles and Games
- [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/): The most fun Christmas themed coding puzzles, ever. Starts off easy, gets progressively harder, teaches you algorithms without boring you. Doing these makes you feel like you can code anything. Suitable for beginners and experts. 2019 is best year.
- [Zachtronics](https://zachtronics.com/): These guys make brilliant, beautiful coding video games. For practical purposes, I'd suggest these if you're just beginning to learn how to code. For fun, these get challenging and scale up to expert programmers. 
  - [Exapunks](https://zachtronics.com/exapunks/): 90s cyberpunk theme
  - [Shenzhen I/O](https://zachtronics.com/shenzhen-io/): A Chinese hardware company job simulator
### Videos
- [Tsoding](https://youtube.com/tsoding): Low-level, functional programming, programming for fun. Free.
- [Destroy All Software](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/): Computation, webdev, Ruby, Unix, Vim, testing and TDD. Costs money.
- [Clean Coder: Fundamentals](https://cleancoders.com/series/clean-code/fundamentals): Really useful guidelines for writing clean code. I only recommend the first 7 videos, they're all good. Costs money.

<a name="cracking"><sup>1</sup></a> This isn't a software engineering Bible, it's a test prep book. However, your potential employer cares way more about
whether or not you can make their website/app than if you memorized about when to use memcached from a book. So why study for the interview like it's
an exam? Code, build stuff, have fun, do Sumcademy.
