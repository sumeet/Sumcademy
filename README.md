> The anti-Cracking the Interview<sup>[1](#cracking)</sup> Curriculum

Publishing some of the coding exercises I've made for the off chance these
might be useful to someone. Feel free to do whatever you'd like with these: copy
them, modify them, solve them, etc.

Stars are difficulty ratings, out of 5.

## Other (better) resources
### Puzzles and Games
- [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/): Christmas themed coding puzzles, start out easy, and get progressively harder. Teaches you algorithms without boring you. Doing these makes you feel like you can code anything. Suitable for beginners and experts. [2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019) is best year.
- [Zachtronics](https://zachtronics.com/): Beautiful coding video games using simplified assembly languages. For practical purposes, I'd suggest these if you're just beginning to learn how to code. For fun, these get challenging and scale up to expert programmers. 
  - [Exapunks](https://zachtronics.com/exapunks/): 90s cyberpunk theme
  - [Shenzhen I/O](https://zachtronics.com/shenzhen-io/): Simulates having a job at a Chinese hardware company
### Videos
- [Tsoding](https://youtube.com/tsoding): Low-level, functional programming, programming for fun. Free.
- [Destroy All Software](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/): Computation, webdev, Ruby, Unix, Vim, testing and TDD. Costs money.
- [Clean Coder: Fundamentals](https://cleancoders.com/series/clean-code/fundamentals): Really useful guidelines for writing clean code. I only recommend the first 7 videos, they're all good. Costs money.

<a name="cracking"><sup>1</sup></a> I don't suggest people to grind away at this book, even though it's really popular. Is it a software engineering Bible? No, it's a test prep book. However, your potential employer cares most about
whether or not you can make their website/app. In the end, preparing for the actual job would be far more useful to both you and the employer. Code, build stuff, have fun, do Sumcademy.
