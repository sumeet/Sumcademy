# Sumcademy

> The anti-Cracking the Interview<sup> [1](#cracking)</sup> Curriculum

Publishing some of the coding exercises I've given for the off chance these
might be useful to someone. Feel free to do whatever you'd like with these: copy
them, modify them, solve them, etc.

- Course O -- 15 exercises (Ruby, webdev, HTTP, sockets)
- Course E -- 2 exercises (Node.js, webdev, Golang)
- Course M -- 1 exercise (Functional programming, Haskell)
- Course G -- 1 exercise (Linux, Command line)

<a name="cracking"><sup>1</sup></a> Your potential employer cares way more about
how much money you'll help them make than how much interview trivia you know.
They want to know if you can make their website, not that you memorized about
caching database queries from a book. So why study for the interview like it's
an exam? Code, build stuff, have fun, do Sumcademy.
